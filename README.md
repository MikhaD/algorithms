# Theory of Algorithms Examples
This repository contains my implementations of ~~all~~ ~~most~~ ~~some~~ (wow I was ambitious when I started this) a few of the algorithms covered in the Theory of Algorithms section of CSC3003S at the University of Cape Town, plus a few extra ones.
I have found that implementing the algorithms myself is the best way to understand them, and I hope that this repository will be useful to others who are doing this course, or just trying to learn more about algorithms.

If you are a university student and you found this helpful, leave a ‚≠ê on the repo :)
